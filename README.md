**Notice: As of July 2025, this is the official NameGame codebase. The AspiringX
org has various other namegame repos that people were using for learning/trying
different languages and features, etc. When this goes live, we'll retire those
to avoid confusion.**

# NameGame

**The relationship game that starts with a name.**

NameGame makes it fun for people in a group to meet, remember names, and get
acquainted. Groups can play for a fee at [namegame.app](https://namegame.app) or
host it themselves.

NameGame is an open source
[AspiringX project](https://github.com/aspiringx/.github). If you're in software
(engineer, UX, product management, etc.) and want to contribute, mentor, and/or
learn by being part of this project, contact me (Joe Tippetts) on
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtippetts/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.

## TODO

- Add instructions for running this locally:
  - On host machine
  - In docker
- Add instructions for deploying this app for groups that want to host it
  themselves.
  - On the same platform we use for namegame.app (Digital Ocean)
    - Cheap and simple for small deployments
  - Possibly elsewhere (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.) if we can vibe code (use AI) to
    easily generate it and have people willing to do the leg work to test and
    maintain it.

- Add instructions for contributing to this project.
  - How we verify identities of people we don't already know
  - How people can contribute without the risk of breaking it, accidentally or
    on purpose, etc.

## Default README content from next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page
auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses
[`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)
to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font
family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js
  features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out
[the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your
feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the
[Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme)
from the creators of Next.js.

[Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying)
for more details.
