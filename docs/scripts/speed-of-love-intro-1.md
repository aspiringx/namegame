Your universe at the speed of love You are a star in a big universe with
billions of stars. While most are distant twinkles, a few are always clustered
nearby. You perceive light and warmth from stars near you. The closer you are,
the more gravity pulls you together, aligning random clusters into
constellations. Families, friends, relationships. You have a unique orbit. At
different stages of your existence, your needs, interests, and desires launch
you in new directions. Escaping the gravity of valued relationships can be hard
but necessary for expanding your known universe. Besides your orbit, every star
system has unpredictable forces that alter your trajectory. Sometimes it’s a
blip. Sometimes a surprising collision that hurls you to obscure places. Alone,
your energy dims. Your signals seem unnoticed, invisible. This happens to every
star, whether by choice, chance, or both. Sometimes dramatically, but more often
in the routine of being a star, looping through a regular life. Human stars have
a superpower: you can travel at the speed of love. With just a thought, you can
be near a distant star again, sharing the comfort of gravity, warmth, and light.

Relation Star is about learning and using this superpower.

direction. It’s all part of expanding your universe.

bright star in this endless sky. Some stars flicker far away, while a few shine
close, forming constellations of meaning—family, friends, relationships.

[Scene 3 – Stars cluster and connect with glowing lines, forming constellations]
As you move through life, your orbit changes. New interests, new connections,

Sometimes you drift away from familiar stars. It’s not loss—it’s expansion. Your
universe is growing.

Unseen forces shift your trajectory—chance meetings, unexpected moments,
collisions that send you toward the unknown.

[Scene 6 – The screen dims slightly; a single star glows faintly, alone in the
dark] At times, your light feels dim, your signal quiet. Every star experiences
this space of distance and reflection.

[Scene 7 – A soft pulse of light; threads of light connect distant stars] But
you have a rare gift: you can travel at the speed of love. With a thought, a
message, a moment—you reconnect.
