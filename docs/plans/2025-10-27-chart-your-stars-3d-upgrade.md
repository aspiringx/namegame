## Terminology and Star Perception Factors

### Critical: These Factors Work Together
**NEVER adjust just one factor in isolation.** Changes to any of these affect how users perceive star size, position, and distance. Always consider the full system when making adjustments.

### The HUD (Heads-Up Display)
- **Definition:** The rectangle bounded by the four green corner markers visible on screen
- **Center:** The crosshairs in the middle of the HUD rectangle
- **Important:** "Centering in HUD" means centering in this rectangle, NOT just the viewport
- **Current state:** HUD center = viewport center (aligned for simplicity)

### Coordinate System & Directions
- **Three.js coordinates:**
  - X-axis: left (-) to right (+)
  - Y-axis: down (-) to up (+)
  - Z-axis: into screen (-) to out of screen (+)
- **Camera movement effects:**
  - Subtracting from `camera.position.y` moves camera DOWN ‚Üí star appears HIGHER on screen
  - Adding to `camera.position.y` moves camera UP ‚Üí star appears LOWER on screen
  - Subtracting from `camera.position.z` moves camera CLOSER ‚Üí star appears LARGER
  - Adding to `camera.position.z` moves camera FARTHER ‚Üí star appears SMALLER
- **Language precision:** Always specify "camera moves down" vs "star appears higher" to avoid confusion

### Factors Affecting Star Appearance (Must Consider Together)
1. **Star size (`baseSize`)** - The 3D object's actual size in world units (currently 3.0)
2. **Camera distance (`viewDistance`)** - How far camera is from star (currently 6.5)
3. **Camera FOV (field of view)** - Set at canvas level, affects perspective (60¬∞)
4. **Camera position:**
   - X: horizontal alignment (currently `targetPos.x`)
   - Y: vertical alignment (currently `targetPos.y - 2`)
   - Z: depth (currently `targetPos.z + 6.5`)
5. **Camera rotation/angle** - Which way camera is looking (currently `lookAt(targetPos)`)
6. **Star opacity** - Affects visibility and perceived distance
7. **Star glow/halo size** - Affects perceived size and brightness
8. **Transition progress** - Affects multiple properties during animation
9. **Distance from camera** - Calculated dynamically, affects LOD and rendering

### Depth Perception Factors
- **Size scaling:** Distant objects appear smaller (perspective)
- **Opacity:** Distant objects appear dimmer
- **Glow intensity:** Closer objects have brighter halos
- **Texture detail:** Faces only visible when close enough
- **Layering:** Z-position affects render order and occlusion

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. ‚ùå Adjusting star size without considering camera distance
2. ‚ùå Changing camera position without checking HUD alignment
3. ‚ùå Modifying one opacity value without checking related opacity calculations
4. ‚ùå Using "up/down" without specifying camera vs screen space
5. ‚ùå Saying "centered" without specifying HUD vs viewport vs world space

## Phase 1: Fix Critical Bugs (Do First)
**Goal:** Make current experience smooth and professional

### 1A. Smooth Camera Transitions Between Stars üîÑ
- **Problem:** Stars disappear/reappear, camera jumps
- **Fix:** Implement smooth camera flight path from star A ‚Üí star B
  - Keep both stars visible during transition
  - Smooth lerp with easing (slow start, fast middle, slow arrival)
  - "Takeoff" animation: pull back from current star before flying to next
  - "Landing" animation: gentle deceleration as we approach target
- **Status:** In progress
- **Implementation:**
  - ‚úÖ Added 'takeoff' phase to journeyPhase state
  - ‚úÖ Added takeoff refs (takeoffProgress, takeoffStartPos, previousStarPos)
  - ‚úÖ Implemented takeoff animation in useFrame (pulls camera back 15 units along Z-axis)
  - ‚úÖ Added onTakeoffComplete callback to transition from takeoff ‚Üí flying
  - ‚úÖ Modified handleProceedAfterPlacement to initiate takeoff instead of direct flying
  - ‚è≥ Need to test: Camera should pull back from star A, then fly smoothly to star B

### 1B. Fix Star Scaling/Opacity During UI Interaction ‚úÖ
- **Problem:** Star becomes bigger/transparent when clicking buttons
- **Fix:** Lock star appearance when "arrived" state is active
  - Disable transition animations during button interaction
  - Only animate during approach/departure phases
- **Status:** Complete
- **Implementation:**
  - ‚úÖ Added locked appearance refs (lockedSize, lockedOpacity, lockedTransitionProgress)
  - ‚úÖ Lock values when `isTarget && (journeyPhase === 'arrived' || 'placed')`
  - ‚úÖ Reset locks when transitioning out of arrived/placed phase
  - ‚úÖ Star now maintains consistent size, opacity, and transition state during UI interaction

### 1C. Improve Constellation Visibility on Mobile ‚úÖ
- **Problem:** 15 constellation stars hard to distinguish from background
- **Fix:** 
  - Increase constellation star brightness (0.9+ opacity vs 0.3 for background)
  - Larger base size for constellation stars
  - Optional: subtle pulsing glow animation
- **Status:** Complete
- **Implementation:**
  - ‚úÖ Boosted opacity during intro phase: 0.6-0.9 (was 0.15-0.7)
  - ‚úÖ Increased size during intro phase: 2.0-3.5 (was 1.5-3.0)
  - ‚úÖ Stars automatically dim/shrink when journey starts to focus on target star

## Phase 2: Convert to 3D Spheres
**Goal:** Transform flat disks into 3D celestial spheres

### 2A. Hybrid 3D Effect ‚úÖ
- ~~Change `circleGeometry` ‚Üí `sphereGeometry`~~ **Decision: Keep flat circles with 3D shading**
- Keep texture mapping working with aspect ratio preservation
- Maintain billboard behavior (face always points to camera)
- **Status:** Complete
- **Decision:** Hybrid approach - flat circles with sphere-like shading when distant
- **Implementation:**
  - ‚úÖ Kept circle geometry for performance and image quality
  - ‚úÖ Added sphere-like shading shader to star core (radial gradient + lighting)
  - ‚úÖ 3D effect visible when distant, fades as images appear
  - ‚úÖ Improved shader to preserve aspect ratio (no stretching)
  - ‚úÖ Billboard behavior maintained through existing lookAt logic
  - ‚úÖ Smooth transition from "3D sphere" to flat image
- **Why hybrid approach:** True spheres caused image quality issues. Flat circles with radial gradient shading provide the illusion of 3D depth when distant, while maintaining clear, high-quality images when close. Best of both worlds with better performance.

### 2B. Add Atmospheric Effects ‚úÖ
- Glowing halo around each sphere (shader or layered meshes)
- ~~Subtle rotation animation when idle~~ **Skipped - not visible with billboard behavior**
- Depth-based fog/glow intensity
- **Status:** Complete
- **Implementation:**
  - ‚úÖ Glowing halo already implemented (soft blue glow layer)
  - ‚úÖ Depth-based glow intensity (opacity varies with distance)
  - ‚úÖ Sphere-like shading with radial gradient
  - ‚è≠Ô∏è Rotation skipped - not visible on billboarded flat circles

### 2C. Camera Behavior Enhancement ‚úÖ
- **Initial flight from overview:**
  1. ‚úÖ Gradual pan from constellation center to target star
  2. ‚úÖ Delayed look direction transition (starts at t=0.2)
  3. ‚úÖ Ease-in-out curve for smooth, cinematic movement
  4. ‚úÖ Constellation stars stay visible and gradually fade
  5. ‚úÖ Photo appears only when close (distance < 40)
  
- **Landing sequence:**
  1. ‚úÖ Smooth deceleration as approaching
  2. ‚úÖ Final position: centered in HUD
  3. ‚úÖ Clean photo display without edge artifacts

- **Status:** Complete (initial flight)
- **Implementation:**
  - ‚úÖ Bezier curve flight path with gradual X/Y panning
  - ‚úÖ Delayed camera look direction transition with easing
  - ‚úÖ Distance-based constellation dimming (stays bright until distance < 80)
  - ‚úÖ Delayed photo transition (starts at 40, complete at 20)
  - ‚úÖ Fixed texture filtering and aspect ratio for clean images
- **Next:** Need to implement takeoff sequence for star-to-star transitions

## Phase 3: Polish & Magic
**Goal:** Make it feel majestic and professional

### 3A. Visual Polish ‚è≥
- Particle trail during flight (stars streaking past)
- Constellation lines that connect stars (fade in when zoomed out)
- Lens flare effect when passing close to bright stars
- Subtle camera shake on takeoff/landing
- **Status:** Not started

### 3B. Animation Refinement ‚è≥
- Easing functions for all movements (no linear motion)
- Face texture fades in as you approach (not instant)
- Sphere rotation slows as you arrive (gives weight/presence)
- **Status:** Not started

### 3C. Performance ‚è≥
- LOD (Level of Detail) for distant spheres
- Optimize texture loading
- Ensure 60fps on mobile
- **Status:** Not started

## Notes & Decisions

### Key Insight: Spaceship Landing/Takeoff
After arriving at a star, the transition to the next should feel like:
1. A spaceship that landed on a moon
2. Takes off (pulls back, rotates)
3. Flies to the next celestial sphere
4. Lands gently in front of it

### Technical Constraints
- Must work on mobile (performance critical)
- WebP textures work with Three.js TextureLoader
- Currently using 15 unique real user photos (thumb.webp)
