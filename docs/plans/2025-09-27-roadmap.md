# Community OS roadmap - September 27, 2025

## Executive Summary

**The Challenge**: Moving beyond the "Now what?" problem after users join and
browse profiles. Need to create clear paths from introduction to deeper
relationship/participation without overwhelming complexity.

**The Vision**: Community OS that starts with names/faces but grows modularly to
support all community functions: communication, events, projects, and
coordination.

**The Strategy**: Context-aware platform that adapts to four distinct group
scenarios with different trust levels and interaction patterns.

## Core Problem Analysis

### The "Now What?" Gap

- Current app excels at names/faces introduction
- Users join, browse, then disengage due to lack of clear next steps
- Need bridge from learning about people to doing things together
- Games about favorite foods don't solve relationship-building

### Key Insight: Context Determines Interaction

Different group types require fundamentally different approaches:

1. **Church** (High Trust) - Facilitate face-to-face connections
2. **Office** (Medium Trust) - Personal discovery within professional context
3. **Extended Family** (Variable Trust) - Memory preservation across
   generations/geography
4. **Neighborhood** (Low/No Trust) - Safe relationship building from scratch

## Technical Architecture Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current + Immediate)

**Goal**: Extend current platform without breaking existing functionality

**Core Infrastructure Additions**:

- Group type classification system (`groupType` field - already implemented)
- Context-aware feature flags per group type
- Communication container framework -Interest/activity tracking system

**Database Schema Extensions**:

```sql
-- New tables to add gradually
CREATE TABLE group_activities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  group_id UUID REFERENCES groups(id),
  type VARCHAR(50), -- 'interest_check', 'event_proposal', 'update', 'chat'
  title VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT,
  creator_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE activity_responses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  activity_id UUID REFERENCES group_activities(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  response_type VARCHAR(20), -- 'Interested', 'not_interested', 'champion'
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE user_interests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  group_id UUID REFERENCES groups(id),
  interest VARCHAR(100),
  visibility VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'group', -- 'group', 'connections_only', 'private'
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Phase 2: Context-Aware Containers (Next 2-3 months)

**Goal**: Implement communication containers that adapt to group type

**Implementation Order**:

1. **Interest Gauging Container** (Universal - works for all group types)
2. **Event Proposal Container** (High impact for church/neighborhood)
3. **Memory Sharing Container** (Family-specific)
4. **Game Challenge Container** (Office-specific)

**Technical Approach**:

- Component-based container system
- Group type determines which containers are available
- Shared UI components with different data models

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (3-6 months)

**Goal**: Group-specific advanced functionality

**By Group Type**:

**Neighborhood**:

- Anonymous interest aggregation ("4 people near you like hiking")
- Progressive disclosure system
- Geographic proximity algorithms

**Church**:

- Pre/post-service connection prompts
- "Who else is here today?" features
- Event coordination that complements (doesn't compete with) main programming

**Extended Family**:

- Parallel life timeline feature
- Memory sharing with photo chronology
- Cross-generational connection tools

**Office**:

- Synchronous game sessions
- Asynchronous ongoing challenges
- Personal discovery prompts

## Implementation Strategy: Avoiding Refactor Traps

### 1. Database Design Principles

- **Extensible not Prescriptive**: Add new tables rather than modifying existing
  ones
- **Polymorphic Relationships**: Use activity/response pattern that works for
  all container types
- **Soft Feature Flags**: Group type + feature flags determine UI, not
  hard-coded logic

### 2. Component Architecture

- **Container Pattern**: Each communication type is a self-contained component
- **Shared Primitives**: Common UI elements (buttons, cards, modals) work across
  containers
- **Context Providers**: Group type context determines which features render

### 3. Progressive Enhancement

- **Additive Features**: New functionality doesn't break existing workflows
- **Graceful Degradation**: Features work even if advanced capabilities aren't
  available
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing groups continue working as new features
  roll out

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### 1. Choose Starting Container

**Recommendation**:Interest Gauging Container

- **Why**: Works for all group types, solves core "Now what?" problem
- **Scope**: Simple thumbs up/down on "Who's interested in..." posts
- **Success Metric**: Users create and respond to interest checks

### 2. Technical Foundation

- [ ] Create `group_activities` and `activity_responses` tables
- [ ] Build basic container UI component
- [ ] Implement interest gauging workflow
- [ ] Add to existing group pages as optional feature

### 3. User Testing Approach

- Test with one group type first (suggest Office - medium complexity)
- Measure engagement: creation rate, response rate, follow-through to actual
  events
- Iterate based on real usage patterns

## Success Metrics by Phase

### Phase 1 (Foundation)

-Interest checks created per week per active group

- Response rate to interest checks (target: >30%)
- User retention after first interest interaction

### Phase 2 (Containers)

- Container usage distribution across group types
- Progression from interest check to actual event/meetup
- User feedback on "Now what?" problem resolution

### Phase 3 (Advanced)

- Group-specific feature adoption rates
- Cross-container user journeys
- Community health metrics (distributed participation, not just volume)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Database Performance**: Index strategy for activity queries
- **UI Complexity**: Component library approach prevents inconsistency
- **Feature Creep**: Strict container boundaries prevent scope expansion

### Product Risks

- **Over-Engineering**: Start with simplest version of each container
- **Context Confusion**: Clear group type indicators and appropriate defaults
- **Adoption Resistance**: Gradual rollout with existing group buy-in

## Long-term Vision Alignment

This roadmap maintains the Community OS vision while providing concrete,
implementable steps:

1. **Modular Growth**: Each container can be developed and deployed
   independently
2. **Context Sensitivity**: Platform adapts to group needs without becoming
   bloated
3. **Relationship Focus**: Moves beyond information sharing to collaborative
   action
4. **Trust Gradient**: Respects different starting points for different group
   types

The key insight: Don't build a social media platform. Build a **community
coordination platform** that happens to start with names and faces.
