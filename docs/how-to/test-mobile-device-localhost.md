# How to Test on a Mobile Device

There are two primary methods for testing the application on a mobile device connected to your local development server.

## Method 1: Using ngrok (Recommended for PWA features)

This method is **required** for testing Progressive Web App (PWA) features like the "Add to Home Screen" prompt, as they require a secure (HTTPS) connection. `ngrok` creates a secure tunnel to your localhost.

1.  **Install ngrok**:
    If you use Homebrew, you can install it with:
    ```bash
    brew install ngrok
    ```
    Otherwise, follow the installation instructions on the [ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/download).

2.  **Authenticate ngrok**:
    - Sign up for a free account at [ngrok.com](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup).
    - Find your authtoken on your [dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
    - Add the authtoken to your ngrok configuration:
      ```bash
      ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_AUTHTOKEN>
      ```

3.  **Start the development server**:
    In your project directory, run the app as usual:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Start ngrok**:
    Open a new terminal window and start ngrok to tunnel your local port 3000:
    ```bash
    ngrok http 3000
    ```

5.  **Access on your mobile device**:
    `ngrok` will provide you with a public HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://random-string.ngrok-free.app`). Open this URL in the browser on your mobile device to test the application.

## Method 2: Using Local IP Address (For non-HTTPS testing)

This method works if your mobile device is on the same Wi-Fi network as your computer. It does not use HTTPS.

1.  **Get your local IP address**:
    - Click the Apple menu ï£¿ at the top-left of your screen.
    - Go to System Settings > Network.
    - Select your active Wi-Fi connection.
    - Your IP address will be listed there (e.g., `192.168.50.177`).

2.  **Run the development server**:
    Start the server and bind it to all available network interfaces:
    ```bash
    npm run dev -- -H 0.0.0.0
    ```

3.  **Access on your mobile device**:
    Open your mobile device's browser and navigate to `http://<your-ip-address>:3000`.
