This document outlines the core principles for designing engaging, fun, and
interactive games that help group members get to know each other. The goal is to
transform static profile data into a dynamic and social experience.

## The Difference Between Data and a Game

| **Static**                            | **Dynamic**                                                                                          |
| The information doesn't change.       | The experience is different each time (new questions, new people).                                   |
| **Informational**                     | **Emotional**                                                                                        |
| The goal is to learn.                 | The goal is to win, compete, or discover, creating feelings of surprise, achievement, and curiosity. |
| **Isolated**                          | **Social**                                                                                           |
| You learn about one person at a time. | You learn in the context of the group, creating shared knowledge and friendly competition.           |

## Core Elements for a Fun Game

To create a compelling experience that users want to return to, our games should
include the following elements:

### 1. A Clear Goal & Challenge

- **Objective:** The user must immediately understand what they need to do
  (e.g., "Guess who...").
- **Challenge:** The answer should not be obvious. Multiple-choice questions are
  a simple and effective way to create a challenge.

### 2. Immediate & Rewarding Feedback

- **Instant Gratification:** Provide immediate feedback on whether an answer is
  correct or incorrect.
- **Positive Reinforcement:** Use visual and auditory cues (e.g., confetti,
  success sounds) to make correct answers feel rewarding. Reveal the correct
  answer in an engaging way (e.g., flipping a card with the person's photo).

### 3. Reward and Recognition

- **Scoring:** Implement a simple point system to track progress.
- **Leaderboards:** Introduce group-specific leaderboards to foster friendly
  competition and encourage replay.
- **Achievements:** Consider long-term rewards like badges for milestones (e.g.,
  "10 in a row!").

### 4. Anticipation & Replayability

- **Variety:** Ensure the game is different each time by randomizing questions,
  facts, and the people involved.
- **Satisfying Loop:** Use progress indicators (e.g., "Question 3 of 5") and a
  final results screen to create a clear beginning and end, encouraging users to
  try again to beat their score.

## Initial Game Idea: "Guess Who"

A great starting point is a classic **"Guess Who" multiple-choice game.**

- **Gameplay:**
  1.  A user is presented with a fun fact (e.g., "Whose favorite food is
      sushi?").
  2.  They choose from four buttons with the names of different group members.
  3.  The game provides instant feedback on their choice.
  4.  After a round of 5-10 questions, a final score is displayed.

This format is simple, directly leverages user profile data, and can easily
incorporate all the core elements of a fun game. To support this, we should
consider adding new, game-friendly fields to the user profile, such as
**"Favorite Food"** and **"Hobbies"**.

## Game Inspirations

Drawing inspiration from successful games can help us build something engaging. Here are some popular group and party games that offer valuable lessons.

### Games Played Together (Synchronous)

These games excel at creating real-time interaction and shared moments.

| Game | How It's Played | Why It Works for Connection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Two Truths and a Lie** | Each person states three "facts" about themselvesâ€”two true, one false. The group votes on the lie. | **Reveals Surprising Facts:** An excellent icebreaker that encourages storytelling and reveals unexpected details about people. |
| **Jackbox Games (e.g., Fibbage)** | Players use their phones to submit funny or believable answers to prompts on a shared screen. | **Fosters Creativity & Humor:** Gives players a simple framework to be clever and funny, creating shared laughter. |
| **Codenames** | Two teams compete to find their agents (words on a grid). A "spymaster" gives one-word clues to their team. | **Builds Team-Thinking:** Success depends on understanding how your friends think, creating satisfying "aha!" moments. |
| **Pictionary / Charades** | One person draws or acts out a word or phrase for their team to guess against the clock. | **Encourages Non-Verbal Fun:** Bypasses knowledge and focuses on performance and interpretation, leading to hilarious moments. |

### Games Played Apart (Asynchronous)

These games are designed for turn-based play, allowing people to connect on their own schedule.

| Game | How It's Played | Why It Works for Connection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Draw Something** | Asynchronous Pictionary. One player draws a word, and another player guesses it later. | **Creates Shared Artifacts:** The drawings themselves become funny, shareable moments and a creative way to interact. |
| **Words With Friends** | Turn-based crossword game similar to Scrabble. | **Fosters Light Competition:** Provides a simple, ongoing competitive link between two people. |
| **"Question of the Day" / Polls** | A daily poll is posted for the group (e.g., "Cats or Dogs?"). | **Sparks Low-Stakes Debate:** An easy way for everyone to voice an opinion and see how they compare to the group, creating conversation starters. |
