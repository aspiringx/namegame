# Considerations for User-Initiated Push Notifications

This document outlines key design considerations for implementing user-initiated push notifications within the application, focusing on scalability, performance, and fair use.

## 1. Admin-to-Group Notifications

This scenario involves allowing group administrators to send push notifications to all members of a group.

### Key Risk: Performance and Scalability

For large groups, synchronously fetching all members and their associated `PushSubscription` records to send notifications is not a scalable approach. This process can be slow, resource-intensive, and may lead to serverless function timeouts.

### Recommendation: Use a Background Job Queue

To mitigate performance issues, this task should be handled asynchronously.

1.  **Queue the Job**: When an admin initiates a group notification, add a job to a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, or a database-backed queue).
2.  **Process Asynchronously**: A separate, long-running worker process should consume jobs from this queue.
3.  **Batch Processing**: The worker can process the notifications in manageable batches, retrieve subscriptions, and send them with appropriate error handling (including retries for transient failures).

This decouples the notification-sending process from the user-facing action, ensuring the application remains responsive and the notification delivery is reliable.

## 2. Member-to-Member Notifications

This scenario involves allowing group members to send push notifications directly to other individuals or groups of individuals.

### Key Risk: Spam and Abuse

Granting users the ability to send push notifications directly to others creates a significant risk of spam, harassment, and abuse. This can quickly degrade the user experience and may cause users to disable notifications for the app entirely.

### Recommendation: Disallow Direct Sending; Use Event-Driven Notifications

Instead of allowing direct member-to-member pushes, notifications should be a consequence of specific, meaningful, and user-consented interactions. This ensures that notifications are relevant and welcome.

Examples of event-driven notifications include:

*   **Mentions**: A user is notified when another user `@mentions` them in a comment or post.
*   **Replies**: A user receives a notification when someone replies to their message.
*   **Content Updates**: Users are notified about new content in a group they are part of (e.g., "A new photo was added to the family album").
*   **Social Interactions**: Notifications for actions like a "like" or "reaction" to a user's post.

By tying notifications to specific events, we maintain a high-quality user experience and prevent the system from being used for unintended or malicious purposes.
