# DigitalOcean Architecture Options for Namegame

This document outlines different deployment architectures for the namegame monorepo on DigitalOcean, from simple to complex.

## Current Architecture: Single DigitalOcean App + PM2

```
DigitalOcean App (1 container)
├── PM2 Process Manager
│   ├── namegame-web (Next.js on :3000)
│   ├── namegame-chat (Socket.IO on :3001)
│   └── namegame-worker (Background jobs)
└── Shared: Database, file system, env vars
```

**Build Command:** `pnpm install && pnpm db:generate && pnpm build:all`
**Run Command:** `pm2-runtime start ecosystem.config.js`

**Pros:**

- ✅ Simple deployment and management
- ✅ Cost-effective (single app pricing)
- ✅ Shared resources and environment
- ✅ Perfect for community-focused use case

**Cons:**

- ❌ Single point of failure
- ❌ Can't scale services independently
- ❌ Resource contention between services

## Option 1: Separate DigitalOcean Apps

Split each service into its own DigitalOcean App:

```
DigitalOcean App: namegame-web
├── Next.js container (:3000)
└── Auto-scaling, CDN, etc.

DigitalOcean App: namegame-chat
├── Socket.IO container (:3001)
└── WebSocket handling

DigitalOcean App: namegame-worker
├── Background job container
└── Queue processing
```

**Deployment:**

- Each app has its own git repo/branch
- Independent build and deploy cycles
- Service-to-service communication via HTTP/WebSocket

**Pros:**

- ✅ Independent scaling per service
- ✅ Isolated failures (chat down ≠ web down)
- ✅ Service-specific configurations
- ✅ Still uses DigitalOcean's managed platform

**Cons:**

- ❌ 3x cost (3 separate apps)
- ❌ Network latency between services
- ❌ More complex deployment coordination
- ❌ Need service discovery/communication

## Option 2: DigitalOcean Kubernetes Service (DOKS)

Use raw Kubernetes for maximum control:

```yaml
# Example Kubernetes deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: namegame-web
spec:
  replicas: 2
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: web
          image: your-registry/namegame-web
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: namegame-chat
spec:
  replicas: 1 # Stateful WebSocket sessions
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: chat
          image: your-registry/namegame-chat
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3001
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: namegame-worker
spec:
  replicas: 2 # Multiple workers for parallel processing
```

**Pros:**

- ✅ Full Kubernetes control and flexibility
- ✅ Advanced scaling and orchestration
- ✅ Multi-pod deployments per service
- ✅ Service mesh capabilities (Istio)
- ✅ Better resource utilization

**Cons:**

- ❌ High complexity (Kubernetes YAML, networking, etc.)
- ❌ Requires Kubernetes expertise
- ❌ More expensive than single app
- ❌ Overkill for community-scale applications

## DigitalOcean Apps vs Raw Kubernetes

| Feature         | DO Apps Platform   | DOKS (Raw K8s)     |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Abstraction** | High (git-based)   | Low (YAML configs) |
| **Complexity**  | Low                | High               |
| **Control**     | Limited            | Full               |
| **Scaling**     | Auto (limited)     | Manual (flexible)  |
| **Networking**  | Managed            | DIY                |
| **Cost**        | Higher per service | Lower per resource |

**DigitalOcean Apps Platform:**

- Uses Kubernetes under the hood but abstracts it away
- Simple git-based deployments with auto-scaling
- Less control but much easier to manage

**DOKS (DigitalOcean Kubernetes Service):**

- Raw Kubernetes cluster you manage yourself
- Full control over pods, services, ingress, etc.
- Requires Kubernetes expertise but maximum flexibility

## Architecture Comparison

| Approach             | Monthly Cost | Complexity | Scalability | Control | Best For            |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| **PM2 (Current)**    | $12-25       | Low        | Limited     | Medium  | Small communities   |
| **Separate DO Apps** | $36-75       | Medium     | Good        | Medium  | Growing communities |
| **DOKS**             | $24-60       | High       | Excellent   | High    | Large scale apps    |

## Recommended Progression

### Phase 1: Community Scale (Current) ✅

- **Architecture:** PM2 in single DigitalOcean App
- **Users:** < 100 concurrent
- **Focus:** Simplicity and cost-effectiveness

### Phase 2: Growth Scale

- **Architecture:** 3 separate DigitalOcean Apps
- **Users:** 100-1000 concurrent
- **Trigger:** When you need independent scaling or have service-specific issues

**Migration steps:**

1. Create separate git repos/branches for each service
2. Set up 3 DigitalOcean Apps with individual deployments
3. Configure service-to-service communication
4. Update DNS/load balancing

### Phase 3: Enterprise Scale

- **Architecture:** DOKS with multi-pod deployments
- **Users:** 1000+ concurrent
- **Trigger:** When you need advanced orchestration, service mesh, or complex scaling

**Migration steps:**

1. Set up DOKS cluster
2. Containerize each service
3. Create Kubernetes manifests
4. Implement service discovery and networking
5. Set up monitoring and observability

## Service-Specific Considerations

### Web Service (Next.js)

- **Stateless:** Easy to scale horizontally
- **CDN-friendly:** Static assets can be cached
- **Auto-scaling:** Works well with DO Apps auto-scaling

### Chat Service (Socket.IO)

- **Stateful:** WebSocket connections tied to specific instances
- **Scaling challenge:** Need sticky sessions or Redis adapter
- **Single instance:** Often better to scale vertically first

### Worker Service (Background Jobs)

- **Queue-based:** Easy to scale by adding more workers
- **Parallel processing:** Multiple instances can process different jobs
- **Resource-intensive:** May need different instance sizes

## Decision Framework

**Choose PM2 (Current) if:**

- Community-focused application
- Cost is primary concern
- Simple deployment preferred
- < 100 concurrent users

**Choose Separate DO Apps if:**

- Need independent scaling
- Services have different resource needs
- Want isolation between services
- 100-1000 concurrent users

**Choose DOKS if:**

- Need advanced orchestration
- Have Kubernetes expertise
- Complex scaling requirements
- 1000+ concurrent users
- Need service mesh or advanced networking

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor current performance** - Watch resource usage and bottlenecks
2. **Identify scaling triggers** - Define metrics that indicate need to migrate
3. **Plan migration strategy** - Prepare for Phase 2 when growth demands it
4. **Document service boundaries** - Clear APIs between web/chat/worker for future separation

---

**Bottom Line:** Start simple with PM2, migrate to separate apps when you need independent scaling, and only move to Kubernetes when you have enterprise-scale requirements and expertise.
